# Tiny Slider 2 for Drupal

This is a [Tiny Slider 2](https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider) fork, inspired by [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) and created by [ganlanyuan](https://github.com/ganlanyuan).

This is a slightly modified version, wich only adds multilanguage capabilities for Drupal websites. Indeed, only install this if you're going to use this amazing slider in a Drupal website and you need to translate some strings, such some default *aria-labels* provided by the slider, in order to improve your site's accessibility in several languages.

Notice that it simply uses `Drupal.t()` to make these strings translatables, so it can be used in a Drupal 7, 8, 9 and 10, at the moment this fork is released.

## How to use
Please refer to the original [ganlanyuan's guide](https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider) for further information about how to use this slider.
